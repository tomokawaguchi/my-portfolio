  Flexi Tennis Leagues needed a landing page where they can display information
  of their new launching SaaS product to obtain new sign-ups. 


  The website was built in GatsbyJS to deliver the best site performance. One of the most challenging components in the project was to develop a logical skill assessment questionnaire, which helps players select a suitable league to join. The questions dynamically adjusts based on the players response.


  This landing page was also developed with UX in mind. A simple navigation to each section with effective sign-up call-to-action buttons during the user journey.

  The site successfully went live a few weeks prior to the official
  launching date of the service. It has been hosted on Netlify where the client
  can maintain it by himself mainly for blog posts.


  As a result of this project, Flexi Tennis leagues has managed to obtain over 300 sign-ups within 3 months of its launch Australia wide.
