aboutDesc: >-
  The app was developed as part of Android Basics Nanodegree by Google at
  Udacity. Because of its requirements, it was developed in Java with no third-party
  libraries.


  The live data is being sourced via The Guardian API with 4 different categories of news lists displayed. Requesting and parsing data were conducted without using any third-party libraries to have a deeper understanding of the process.


  To showcase the lists of news in a simple and tidy way, ViewPager2 and TabLayout were utilised.
