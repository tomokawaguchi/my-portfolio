  This was a personal project with designs supplied from the Frontend Mentor website (a collaborative learning platform). The website is a mock audio products e-commerce site where users can browse through products and actually select products and its quantity. On the cart page, the selected products, quantity and total price can be seen and they are interactive. This was built in HTML, SCSS and vanilla JavaScript. 


  Since this site has no database, the cart data was stored in the localstorage and the default product details are stored in JSON data locally. Managing the products and quantity in the cart was one of the challenging aspects for this project.

  The site development was completed within 3 days. As a result of this project, I have learnt the utilisation of localstorage in JavaScript and deepen my knowledge of handling data with objects and arrays.
