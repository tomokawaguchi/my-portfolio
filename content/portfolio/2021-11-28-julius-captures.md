aboutDesc: >-
  Julius provides photography and videography services and he needed a website where he can showcase his portfolio for his clients. Since he would like to maintain the website contents by himself, WordPress was selected as the CMS. 


  One of the challenging aspects for this project was to provide him with 4 different design options for the portfolio category pages. This was achieved by setting options field with ACF in the backend and writing logic conditions for it in PHP.


  This custom theme was developed without any plugins except ACF and Formidable forms.
